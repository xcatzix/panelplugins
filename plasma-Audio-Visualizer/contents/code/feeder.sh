#
# cava is built with a fixed set of input backends and distros do not agree on
# which ones: a `method` that was not compiled in, or a sound server that is not
# running, makes cava either exit immediately or sit there emitting nothing. So
# instead of hardcoding pipewire we probe candidates until one actually produces
# a frame, and record the outcome in $RUN/status so the widget can say what went
# wrong instead of drawing a flat line forever.
